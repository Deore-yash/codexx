# codexx

Simple static demo site from the workspace.

Files of interest:
- `codex.html` — main page
- `codex.css` — styles
- images in the repo used by the page

Preview locally:

1. Open `codex.html` directly in a browser, or
2. Run a simple HTTP server from the repo root:

```sh
python -m http.server
# then open http://localhost:8000/codex.html
```

No build tools required.

If you'd like, I can add a license, more docs, or CI for previews.
